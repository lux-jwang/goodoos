def euclidean_distances(X, Y, squared=False, inverse=True):
    """
    Considering the rows of X (and Y=X) as vectors, compute the
    distance matrix between each pair of vectors.

    An implementation of a "similarity" based on the Euclidean "distance"
    between two vectors X and Y. Thinking of items as dimensions and
    preferences as points along those dimensions, a distance is computed using
    all items (dimensions) where both users have expressed a preference for
    that item. This is simply the square root of the sum of the squares of
    differences in position (preference) along each dimension.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array of shape (n_samples_1, n_features)

    Y: array of shape (n_samples_2, n_features)

    squared: boolean, optional
        This routine will return squared Euclidean distances instead.

    inverse: boolean, optional
