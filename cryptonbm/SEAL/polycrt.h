    /**
    Provides functionality for encrypting several plaintext numbers into one ciphertext
    for improved memory efficiency and efficient vector operations (SIMD). Multiplying and 
    adding such ciphertexts together performs the respective operation on each of the slots 
    independently and simultaneously.

    Mathematically speaking, if poly_modulus is x^n+1 and plain_modulus is a prime number t such
    that 2n divides t-1, then integers modulo t contain a primitive 2n-th root of unity and
    the polynomial x^n+1 splits into n distinct linear factors as x^n+1 = (x-a_1)*...*(x-a_n) mod t,
    where the constants a_1, ..., a_n are all the distinct primitive 2n-th roots of unity in integers
    modulo t. The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) states that the plaintext space Z_t[x]/(x^n+1)
    in this case is isomorphic (as an algebra) to the n-fold direct product of fields Z_t. 
    The isomorphism is easy to compute explicitly in both directions, which is what an instance
    of this class can be used for. We refer to the modulus t as the slot modulus. Typically when
    an instance of PolyCRTBuilder is created, the slot modulus is set to be the plaintext modulus.

    @par Thread Safety
    The PolyCRTBuilder class is not thread-safe and a separate PolyCRTBuilder instance is needed
    for each potentially concurrent usage. However, certain important functions of PolyCRTBuilder
    are safe to call from several threads concurrently as long as the threads are guaranteed to
    never access the same slot simultaneously, or mutate a BigUInt or BigPoly while another thread
    is using it, as these objects are not thread-safe.
